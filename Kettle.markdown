### Regular Maintenance

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the kettle's performance. Descale the kettle every two to four weeks, depending on the hardness of the water in your area. Use a descaling solution approved for electric kettles, and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools that can damage the interior.

To descale the kettle fill the kettle with water up to the “MAX” line, then add the recommended amount of descaling solution. Boil the mixture and let it sit for the time indicated by the descaling product. Empty the kettle and rinse it thoroughly with clean water multiple times to remove any remaining solution.
Do not immerse the kettle or its base in water at any time. Use a damp cloth to wipe the exterior.

### Storage Instructions

When storing the kettle, ensure that it is completely dry. Wind the power cord neatly around the base, if the design permits. Store the kettle in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
